Tokens are a terrific way to centralize the low-level values, which you then use to compose the styles that make up the design of your component or app.\"\n\nDesign tokens bridge the gap between design and development. Instead of using static hardcoded values, you name properties that represent visual attributes (such as color, font families, layers, sizing, spacing).
